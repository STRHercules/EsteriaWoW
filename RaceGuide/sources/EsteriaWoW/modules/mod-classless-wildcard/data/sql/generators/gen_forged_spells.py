Every spell is a donor row with fields overridden, never a row built from
nothing: that way attributes, interrupt flags and equipped-item requirements
come from a spell the game already ships and already works.

Damage and healing come off the anchors in CURVE, which were measured from the
median of every trainable class rank at that level. Anything the curve cannot
price -- a damage reduction, an interrupt lockout -- is a literal, checked by
hand against a named spell and recorded in the recipe's `compare` field.
