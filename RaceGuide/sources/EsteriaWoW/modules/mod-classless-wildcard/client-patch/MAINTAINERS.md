# Client patch internals

Player-facing instructions are in [`README.md`](README.md). This file is the
how-and-why, for maintaining the thing.

## Why it is built this way

The patch is **generated on the player's machine from their own client**, never
shipped prebuilt. Two reasons:

1. No Blizzard data lives in this repository.
2. The edits are applied on top of whatever the client already has. A player
   running a community patch pack that already replaced `ChrClasses.dbc` or
   `GlueStrings.lua` gets our changes layered onto *their* version instead of
   silently reverting to the vanilla one.

That second point is why `lib/clientfs.py` exists. It reconstructs the client's
own archive priority order and reads the copy of a file that actually wins:

```
Data/<locale>/patch-<locale>-{Z..A,9..2}.MPQ     highest
Data/<locale>/patch-<locale>.MPQ
Data/<locale>/{lichking,expansion}-{locale,speech}-<locale>.MPQ
Data/<locale>/{speech,locale,base}-<locale>.MPQ
Data/patch-{Z..A,9..2}.MPQ
Data/patch.MPQ
Data/{lichking,expansion,common-2,common}.MPQ    lowest
```

The installer then writes its own archives at the **highest free letter**
(searching Z downwards), so it lands above everything already installed without
colliding with it. The chosen letter is recorded in
`ClasslessWildcard-install.json` in the WoW folder, so a re-run replaces its own
archives instead of accumulating new ones, and `--uninstall` knows what to remove.

## No StormLib

`lib/mpq.py` is a self-contained MPQ implementation, which is what removes the
"build a C tool first" step that made the old process unusable.

- **Reading** handles what WotLK archives actually contain: v1–v4 headers,
  archives past 4 GiB via the hi-block table, encrypted files, single-unit files,
  sector CRCs, and zlib / bzip2 / PKWARE-DCL / stored sectors.
- **Writing** emits exactly what StormLib emits — v1 header, unencrypted,
  zlib-compressed sectors with an offset table — so any MPQ reader can open the
  result. Verified against `mpyq`, an unrelated implementation, which recovers
  every file byte-for-byte.

`lib/pkware.py` is only reached if some archive in the stack uses PKWARE
compression. Blizzard's WotLK archives use zlib, so on a stock client this code
never runs.

## What the patch actually changes

### `ChrClasses.dbc` — the class name

3.3.5a build 12340 layout, 60 `uint32` fields per record:

| Field   | Meaning                                                    |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0       | class ID                                                   |
| 3       | pet name token                                             |
| 4–19    | `Name_lang`, one column per locale                         |
| 20      | `Name_lang` mask                                           |
| 21–36   | `NameFemale_lang`  (37 = mask)                             |
| 38–53   | `NameMale_lang`    (54 = mask)                             |
| 55      | filename token — `WARRIOR`, `DEATHKNIGHT`, …               |

All three name blocks are pointed at one new string. **Field 55 is deliberately
left alone**: class colours, class icons and every addon that keys off the class
token depend on it. The original string block is preserved intact and the new
name appended, because the token offsets point into it.

The client renders whichever `Name_lang` column matches its locale, so every
column is set rather than just column 0.

### `CharBaseInfo.dbc` — creation screen combinations

Two bytes per record, `(race, class)`. Rebuilt as one row per playable race
`(1–8, 10, 11)` — 10 rows, down from the stock 62 — all pointing at a single
**cosmetic shell class**.

The shell is **Paladin** (`SHELL_CLASS` in `install.py`), which is also the
server chassis — so a Hero is created as a Paladin directly, with native mana
and no runtime class change. Paladin is only vanilla-creatable by four races, so
the module's auto-applied `cw_world_hero_races.sql` adds the missing
`playercreateinfo` rows for the other six (Orc/Night Elf/Undead/Tauren/Gnome/
Troll); stats derive from `player_race_stats` x `player_class_stats`, so only the
start position and action bar need adding.

### `Spell.dbc` — the class tool requirement

234 `uint32` per record. Four columns are cleared, and only for spells that
appear on a category-7 (class) `SkillLineAbility` row:

```
50, 51     Totem[2]                  a named item the caster must hold
222, 223   RequiredTotemCategoryID   a tool category: Earth Totem, Runeforge
```

A Hero draws spells from every class and is handed no class's tools, so
Stoneskin Totem arrives with a red `Tools: Earth Totem` line and will not cast.
The server clears the same two fields on its own `SpellInfo`, always and not
optionally; the client copy is what removes the tooltip line and stops the
client refusing the cast before it is ever sent, so both halves are needed and
neither is a setting — a server that kept the requirement would disagree with
every client on the realm. Profession recipes keep their hammer and their skinning
knife — around 2190 rows still require a tool after the pass. Reagents are a
different mechanism and are untouched.

`lib/dbc.py: clear_spell_tools()` does the work and `class_spell_ids()` builds
the set it is scoped to. `build_data_patch` runs it, then `elemental.apply`
appends the variant rows to the *patched* table rather than re-reading the
archive copy.

### `GlueStrings.lua` — the creation screen copy

The keys the 3.3.5a creation screen reads, per class token:

```
CLASS_<TOKEN>            long paragraph, |n for line breaks
CLASS_<TOKEN>_FEMALE     same paragraph, female phrasing
CLASS_INFO_<TOKEN><N>    bullet list, N = 0..5 (most classes have 5, some 6)
```

`lib/gluestrings.py` rewrites those 76 keys for all ten tokens and passes the
other ~860 strings through untouched. Edit `PARAGRAPH` and `BULLETS` there to
change the pitch.

> The old version of this script targeted keys named `WARRIOR_INFO_TEXT` and
> `WARRIOR_ROLE_TANK`. Those do not exist in any 3.3.5a client, so it silently
> rewrote nothing. If you change the key set, verify against a real client.

The remaining three edits below are the `--creation-text` / `--hero-icon`
visual extras. Text and hide-class ride in the locale patch and need the exe
patch; the outfit and icon are plain data and do not.

### `CharacterCreate.lua` — hide the single-class selector (`--creation-text`)

The server offers one class per race, so the creation screen shows a lone class
button. `lib/charcreate.py` appends a hook to the client's own
`CharacterCreate.lua` that wraps `CharacterCreateEnumerateClasses` and hides
every `CharacterCreateClassButton` after the original runs. Append-only: the
original file is passed through untouched. Class selection is separate state
(`SetCharacterClass`, driven by `GetSelectedClass`), so hiding the buttons does
not affect Accept. The override ships in the locale patch, which outranks the
client pack's copy.

### `CharStartOutfit.dbc` — the Hero starter gear (`--creation-text`)

74 `uint32` per record: ID, packed `(race,class,gender,outfit)`, then
`ItemID[24]`, `DisplayInfoID[24]`, `InventoryType[24]`. The model is drawn from
the **DisplayInfoID** array, not the item IDs.

`lib/outfit.py` rewrites every Hero's shell-class (Paladin) row to wear exactly
the neutral starter kit the module equips at first login -- Recruit's shirt,
pants and boots (`STARTER_ITEMS` = 38, 39, 40, the module's default
StarterKit.Equip) -- with no weapon, because the module drops the starter
weapons in the bag rather than equipping them. So the creation preview matches
what a new Hero actually wears. Display ids and slots are resolved from the
client's own CharStartOutfit rows, so nothing is invented; a shell-class row is
added for every race+gender that lacks one (six races cannot be Paladins in
vanilla), so no Hero previews naked. If a realm changes StarterKit.Equip, update
STARTER_ITEMS to match.

### `UI-Classes-Circles.blp` — the Hero emblem (`--hero-icon`)

The class icon is a 4×4 grid in a 256×256 atlas (`CLASS_ICON_TCOORDS` maps each
token to a cell). `lib/blp.py` **decodes** the client's own atlas (`decode_blp`,
handling palettized and DXT1/3/5), pastes the gold emblem into the
**Paladin** cell (`_HERO_CELLS_TC`) -- Paladin is the Hero's class (shell and
chassis), so that is the cell its own class icon is drawn from -- and re-encodes.
Every other class icon is preserved untouched.

Only `UI-Classes-Circles` is rewritten -- that is the atlas the game uses for a
unit's own class icon (unit frames, character select, the creation-screen class
icon). The addon draws its by-class ability tabs from a DIFFERENT atlas,
`UI-CharacterCreate-Classes` (see `CLASS_TCOORDS` in ClasslessWildcard.lua),
which is left alone, so putting the Hero mark on the Paladin cell shows
it on the Hero's frame WITHOUT touching the addon's class grouping. This keeps
the Paladin chassis (real native mana) and a Hero emblem at the same time. Writes over
`Interface\TargetingFrame\UI-Classes-Circles.blp` (in-game, character select,
the addon's icons) and the creation-screen atlas.

> Earlier tries got this wrong twice: filling *every* cell erased the icons the
> addon needs, and rewriting `UI-CharacterCreate-Classes` broke the addon's
> class tabs. The addon reads `UI-CharacterCreate-Classes`; leave it alone and
> only reskin `UI-Classes-Circles`.

To read the pristine original on a reinstall (not the installer's own previous
output), `install.py` builds its `ClientFiles` with `exclude=` set to the patch
archives it is about to write.

The BLP **format matters** — a wrong header makes the client draw a green
"missing texture" box everywhere the icon is used. Matched byte-for-byte against
the genuine enc=1 textures the client ships: header `01 08 08 01` (encoding 1
palettized, alphaDepth 8, **alphaType 8**, **hasMips 1**) with a **full mip
chain** (256→1, `w*h` index bytes + `w*h` alpha bytes per level). alphaType 0 or
a missing mip chain both fail to load. Pillow is required: `install.py` installs
it with pip when missing and aborts if it cannot, because a client without the
painted icons is not the full install.

The full Hero client -- name, single-class list, text, outfit, icon, exe patch,
addon -- installs by **default**; the `--no-*` flags turn single pieces off
for testing. The icon needs no exe patch (textures are not signature-checked) and can be
skipped with `--no-hero-icon`. Swap `_draw_emblem` in `lib/blp.py` to change the
mark.

### `Wow.exe` — the "allow custom interface" patch

Replacing `GlueStrings.lua` makes the client reject the whole interface set with
*"Your login interface files are corrupt"* unless the interface signature check
is disabled. `--creation-text` applies the well-known signature-scope bypass to
`Wow.exe` so the custom text loads. The default install never touches the exe.

> An earlier version shipped a single-byte flip at `0x243F` and claimed it did
> this. It was wrong: `0x243F` is next to the *MPQ data* signature strings
> (`0x9E0387`, *"game's signature version"*), not the GlueXML check, whose
> strings live at `0x9F2AC4` (*"GlueXML is modified or corrupt"*). It patched an
> unrelated branch, so the client still rejected custom glue. Never re-add a
> byte-flip without confirming which check it hits.

The correct patch is six same-length in-place edits inside the signature-scope
validation function, taken from the Project Reforged 3.3.5 patcher
(`patch-004-allow_interface_edit.bat`,
<https://github.com/Stormhand-dev/WoW-3.3.5-Patcher---Project-Reforged>). On a
stock 12340 exe they sit at these file offsets:

| offset     | from → to                       | effect                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `0x1F41BC` | `74 39` → `EB 39`               | `jz` → `jmp` (take accept path) |
| `0x415A25` | `75 05` → `EB 05`               | `jnz` → `jmp`                   |
| `0x415A3B` | `B8 01…` → `B8 03…`             | `mov eax,1` → `mov eax,3`       |
| `0x415A93` | `B8 01…` → `B8 03…`             | `mov eax,1` → `mov eax,3`       |
| `0x415B46` | `7F 12` → `EB 12`               | `jg` → `jmp`                    |
| `0x415B5D` | `83 C0 03 … 5D C3 CC` → `B8 03…`| force return scope 3            |

Scope `3` is the value the check treats as valid, so making the function always
return it accepts modified UI files.

`lib/exepatch.py` does not hard-code offsets — it carries the byte *patterns*
and, before writing, requires each to match the target exe **exactly once**
(same length in, same length out), so a client the set does not fit is refused
rather than corrupted. It writes `Wow.exe.classless-bak` first, is idempotent
(re-running detects the patched form), and `restore()` reverts from the backup
or, failing that, by reversing the unique patched patterns in place. A seventh
Reforged pattern (`00 A1 26` → `00 16 4E`) is absent from stock 12340 and is
applied only if present.

Verified on a real 12340 exe: 6 sites, 12 bytes changed, `apply → inspect →
restore` round-trips byte-identical, **and confirmed at the login/character
screen** — with the patch applied, the custom `GlueStrings.lua` loads and the
creation screen shows the Hero description instead of the corrupt-interface
error.

## Testing

`test_elemental.py` checks the elemental-variant step against a DBC extract, no
client needed: it appends every variant in `elemental_manifest.json` to real
Spell, SpellVisual, SpellIcon and SkillLineAbility tables, reads the rows back
and compares them with the manifest, and paints every element's icon on a
synthetic BLP.

```bash
python3 test_elemental.py --dbc "B:/New folder/dbc"
```

`preview_elemental_icons.py` renders every shipped base icon in every element
from a real client's art into one sheet, at twice the in-game size, so a change
to the element colours or to `render_icon` can be judged before anyone
reinstalls:

```bash
python3 preview_elemental_icons.py "B:/World.of.Warcraft.3.3.5a" --out preview.png
```

The manifest itself is generated, together with the server's SQL, by
`data/sql/generators/gen_elemental_variants.py`; regenerate both from one run
so the server's numbers and the client's tooltips stay identical. Each run stamps a
twelve-digit generation id into both: the installer prints it in its report and the
worldserver logs it when it registers the variants, so a server and a client from
different runs can be told apart at a glance. Its defaults
produce the shipped set; `--bases ALL --elements ALL --ranks all` produces
every eligible strike, and `--bases "Sinister Strike" --elements fire --ranks
first` is the single-variant spike used to prove the pipeline. After any
regeneration the server needs a restart and every player a client reinstall.

`selftest.py` runs the whole pipeline against a real client without writing to it:

```bash
python3 selftest.py "B:/World.of.Warcraft.3.3.5a"
```

It resolves each source file through the archive chain, applies every transform,
builds the archives in a temp folder, reads them back, and — if `mpyq` is
installed — cross-checks with that independent reader.

Run it against any client you can get hold of before tagging a release,
especially a non-enUS one.

## Known gaps

- Only `enUS` string keys are verified. Other locales use the same key names, so
  they should work, but the installer aborts with a clear message rather than
  writing a no-op patch if nothing matches.
- Incremental MPQ patch files (`MPQ_FILE_PATCH_FILE`) are not applied. No
  3.3.5a archive in the normal load order uses them; if one did, the reader
  raises rather than returning wrong bytes.
- `Wow.exe` is never modified, so the creation-screen *description text*
  (`--creation-text`) only works on clients that do not enforce GlueXML
  signatures. There is no in-installer bypass for clients that do.

## Extending the patch

`mpq.write_archive(path, {"archive\\path": b"..."})` takes any set of files, so
custom `Spell.dbc` rows, icons or `TalentTab.dbc` edits go in the same archive.
Keep DBC edits matched with the server-side data or the client will disagree
with the server.
