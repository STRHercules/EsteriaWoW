"""Check the forged spell rows before they ever reach a server.

Reads the generator's own outputs -- forged_manifest.json and
cw_spells_forged.sql -- and asserts the properties that keep the set safe:
nothing inherits a class family, nothing is auto-granted, nothing sits off the
curve, and no hidden companion can show up in a spellbook tab.

Run:  python3 test_forged.py [CLIENT_DIR]

With a client directory it also applies the rows to that client's own tables in
memory and reads them back, which is the only way to know the appends land where
