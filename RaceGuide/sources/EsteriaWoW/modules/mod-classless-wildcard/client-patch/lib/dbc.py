"""The DBC edits the classless client patch needs.

ChrClasses.dbc         - what every class is called on screen, and that it has
                         a ranged slot rather than a relic slot.
CharBaseInfo.dbc       - which race/class pairs the creation screen offers.
SkillRaceClassInfo.dbc - which class skill lines the client accepts for the
                         character.
SkillLineAbility.dbc   - which class each class spell belongs to, which is
                         what actually decides the spellbook's tab set.
Spell.dbc              - the class tool a spell demands before it may be cast.

Both are rewritten from the copy already winning in the client's archive stack,
so a community patch's version is preserved rather than reverted.

    """Lower each spell's cost to the least any Hero build could pay.

    The client checks power itself before it will send a cast, and it cannot
    apply a talent from another class to that check any more than it can to a
    tooltip: the modifier packet carries a class-mask bit and no spell family,
    so the client only ever matches the chassis's own. With Improved Thunder
    Clap the server wanted 16 rage and the client still refused at 16, saying
    "Not enough rage" without sending anything.

    The server is the authority on what a cast costs, so the fix is to make the
    client's copy permissive: set it to the lowest cost any combination of
    talents could produce. A Hero WITH the talents can then cast at their real
    cost, and one WITHOUT gets the same refusal as before -- from the server
    instead of locally, with the same message.

    The tooltip is not left showing the lowered number: the server sends the
    true cost for every costed spell a Hero owns and the addon writes it in.

    Never raises a cost, and never takes one to zero -- a cost of zero prints
    no cost line at all, and then there is nothing for the addon to correct.

    `stock_costs` is the table to read the ORIGINAL cost from, when spell_data
    has already been through another step. Pass the client's own untouched
    Spell.dbc: read the base from the row being written and a second run would
    reduce the already-reduced number, so running the installer twice would walk
    every cost down to the floor.

    `extra_modifier_spells` names talent spells that Talent.dbc does not list.
    The Hero tree is a world table on the server and never reaches the client's
    Talent.dbc, so the talents that reduce a forged spell's cost -- Thrift is
    the one that does today -- were invisible here: the server charged 70% and
    the client still refused at 100%, which is the Improved Thunder Clap bug
    again with the module's own talents. Pass the deepest rank of each such
    talent; the modifier itself is read out of the spell row like any other.

    `pct_families` names the spell families whose PERCENTAGE cost may also be
    lowered. A percentage-priced spell has a ManaCost of zero and was skipped
    outright, so a reduction on one could never reach the client -- but lowering
    it has a price of its own: the tooltip then reads the lowered number for
    anyone WITHOUT the talent, and only a correction from the server puts it
    back. The server sends one for every spell with a flat cost and for none
    priced by percentage, because doing that once overwrote 1474 correct caster
    tooltips with the server's own arithmetic. So this is opt-in and empty by
    default; the installer passes the module's own family, where the correction
    is guaranteed. Only the multiplying modifiers apply here in any case: a flat
    modifier is in power units and there is no base mana in this table to turn it
    into a percentage.
