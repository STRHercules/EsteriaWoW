"""Elemental ability variants, client side.

The generator (data/sql/generators/gen_elemental_variants.py) writes the
server's spell rows and, from the same run, elemental_manifest.json. This
module turns that manifest into the client's half:

  Spell.dbc             one appended row per variant rank, copied from the
                        base spell's own row in THIS player's client and
                        patched with the manifest's field overrides and text
  SpellVisual.dbc       one row per variant: the base visual with the
                        element's impact kit
  SpellIcon.dbc         one row per (base icon, element)
  SkillLineAbility.dbc  one row per variant, so it files under its base's tab
  Interface/Icons/      one painted icon per (base icon, element), built from
                        the player's own copy of the base icon

Everything is appended to the player's own tables, so a community patch's
rows survive, and nothing of Blizzard's is carried in the repository: the
manifest holds ids, overrides and text, not copies of rows or art.

Pillow is required by the installer; without it apply() refuses to paint and
the install stops. (Earlier versions fell back to the base icons, which is how
variants ended up looking exactly like the ability they came from.) Without it
the variants would still work and simply show their
base's icon.
