"""Dress the character-creation preview in the Hero starter gear.

CharStartOutfit.dbc drives the gear shown on the previewed character (by
DisplayInfoID). Left alone, the shell class (Paladin) previews in whatever a
Paladin starts with -- and that varies by race and shows a weapon. Instead this
rebuilds every Hero's shell-class row to wear exactly the neutral starter kit the
module equips at first login (Recruit's shirt/pants/boots), with no weapon,
because the module drops the starter weapons into the bag rather than equipping
them. So the creation preview matches what a new Hero actually wears.

The item ids here mirror the module's default `StarterKit.Equip`
(`38,39,40`). Their display ids and slots are resolved from the client's own
CharStartOutfit data, so nothing is invented; if a realm changes StarterKit.Equip
to different armour, update STARTER_ITEMS to match.

It also fills real gaps: the Paladin shell is only vanilla-creatable by four
races, so the other six (and any race missing a row) get a shell-class row added,
built the same way, so no Hero previews naked.

None of this needs the exe patch -- it is data. It ships with --creation-text
only to keep all the visual extras behind one flag.
