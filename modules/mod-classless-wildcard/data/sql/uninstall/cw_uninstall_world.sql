-- mod-classless-wildcard: WORLD DB uninstall.
-- NOT auto-applied — run by hand, with the worldserver STOPPED, only when
-- removing the module. See "Uninstall / revert" in README.md.

-- Class requirements on quests, put back before the backup table is dropped.
-- The module clears quest_template_addon.AllowableClasses so any Hero can take
-- any class's chain; these are the masks it recorded on the way in. Guarded,
-- because the table is absent on an install that never applied the world SQL
-- and a missing-table error here would abort the rest of this script.

--    revision. Masks cleared by the current cw_world_item_classes.sql are put
--    back above.
--  * leftover playercreateinfo* INSERTs from older versions are harmless to
--    keep (the client no longer offers those combos); restore from backup if
--    you want them gone.
