# Client setup

Required for every player on a Classless Wildcard realm. The
[module README](../README.md) explains why.

> ## Close World of Warcraft before you run this
>
> The installer deletes your client cache for you, every time it runs, and it
> checks afterwards that the files are really gone. A running game holds those
> files open: nothing is deleted, and the installer will say so in capitals at
> the end of its report.

> If you see that message: close the game, delete the `Cache` folder in your WoW
> directory, and start the game again. Until you do, new items draw the wrong
> icon or a question mark and ranged weapons say "Out of range".

**One installer sets up the full Hero client:**

- every class shows as **Hero**, everywhere it appears
- the creation screen offers a **single class per race** (no class to choose)
- the creation-screen **class description** is the Hero pitch, and the leftover
  class selector is hidden
- new characters wear an **armored Hero outfit** on the creation screen
- the **Hero emblem** replaces the class icon *for the Hero only*. Every other
  class icon is kept, so your addon can still group abilities by class
- the **elemental ability variants**: the spell rows, tooltips and badged icons
  for the Fiery, Frozen, Earthen, Venomous, Arcane, Shadow and Holy versions of
  the physical strikes that have them (`--no-elemental` leaves them out)
- class spells no longer ask for a **class tool** such as an Earth Totem, so the
  tooltip drops the red `Tools:` line and the spell casts. The server clears the
  same requirement; both halves are needed or the client refuses the cast on its
  own. Reagents are untouched
- **every talent tree is opened to every class**, so the client accepts a Hero's
  cross-class talents instead of dropping them. It does NOT make spell tooltips
  count them -- the addon does that. The stock talent frame draws three trees
  and there are now thirty, so read a build in the addon's talent browser
- **talent-reduced costs can be paid**: the client checks power itself before
  it will send a cast and cannot count a cross-class talent, so its copy of
  each cost is lowered to the least any build could pay and the server
  decides. The addon writes the true cost back onto the tooltip
- **the classless items are registered with the client**, so their icons draw
  the moment a bag is opened. A stock item's icon comes from the client's own
  Item.dbc; a custom one has no row there, so nothing can draw it until the
  server answers an item query and a bag addon shows a question mark instead
- the **ClasslessWildcard** addon is installed

The creation-screen text is a *signed* interface file, so the installer also applies
the well-known "allow custom interface" patch to `Wow.exe` (backed up first,
reversible with `--uninstall`). **Close World of Warcraft before installing.**

### About that cache

The client keeps its own copy of every item, spell and creature the server has
ever told it about, in

```
<your WoW folder>\Cache\WDB\<locale>\
```

for example `C:\Games\World of Warcraft\Cache\WDB\enUS\`. That copy is
stale the moment the realm's data changes, and a stale entry does not fix itself:
an item cached before its stats existed keeps drawing a red question mark and
refuses to equip, and a ranged weapon cached with no range keeps answering "Out
of range" whatever the database now says.

The installer deletes it, counts what it deleted, and tells you if anything
survived. One case it cannot cover: the realm applying new SQL without you
re-running the installer. Changed items reach you through the server, not the
patch, so nothing has cleared your cache. Delete `Cache` and log back in.

Deleting it is always safe. It is a cache: nothing of yours lives there, and the
client fills it in again as you play.

`--uninstall` restores everything the installer changed, `Wow.exe` included.

> The Hero emblem and the elemental ability icons are painted with the Python **Pillow**
> library. The installer installs it with pip when it is missing and stops if it cannot.

## What you need

- Your **World of Warcraft 3.3.5a** folder, the one with `Wow.exe` and `Data` in it.
- **Python 3** (any version from 3.7 up).
  Windows: get it from [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and
  tick **"Add python.exe to PATH"** on the first screen of the installer.

Nothing else. No compiler, no StormLib, no MPQ editor, no extra downloads.

> The Hero emblem and the elemental ability icons are painted with the Python
> **Pillow** imaging library, so the install needs it. `install.bat`, `install.sh`
> and `install.py` each install it with pip when it is missing, and stop if that
> fails. Nothing else is downloaded.

---

## Install

### Windows

**Double-click `install.bat`.**

The first run asks for your WoW folder and remembers it in `install_path.txt`
beside the installer, so later runs go straight through without asking. Edit that
file to point somewhere else, or delete it to be asked again. You can also write
it yourself before the first run: one line holding the path, and lines starting
with `#` are ignored. Dragging your WoW folder onto `install.bat` still works and
takes priority over the file.

The installer shows what it is about to do and confirms once before touching
anything. **Close World of Warcraft first**, because the install patches
`Wow.exe`, which the running game locks.

### macOS / Linux

```bash
./install.sh "/path/to/World of Warcraft"
```

### Any system, explicitly

```bash
python3 install.py "C:\Games\World of Warcraft"
```

Want to see exactly what would happen before committing to it?

```bash
python3 install.py --dry-run "C:\Games\World of Warcraft"
```

That writes nothing at all. It just prints the plan.

### What you should see

```
mod-classless-wildcard client installer
=======================================

World of Warcraft : C:\Games\World of Warcraft
Locales           : enUS
Class name        : Hero
Creation text     : yes
Armored outfit    : yes
Hero class icon   : yes
Patch Wow.exe     : yes
Addon             : yes

Install to this client? [Y/n] y

  ChrClasses.dbc   10 classes renamed to Hero
  ChrClasses.dbc   ranged slot restored on 4 relic classes (bows, guns and wands now show)
  CharBaseInfo.dbc all 10 races, one cosmetic class (shown as Hero)
  SkillRaceClassInfo.dbc  86 class skill lines opened to every class
  SkillLineAbility.dbc  3143 class spells now belong to every class (spellbook tabs for cross-class spells)
  TalentTab.dbc     30 talent trees opened to every class (the client accepts cross-class talents)
  Spell.dbc        class tool requirement cleared from 102 spells (totems, relics; reagents untouched)
  Spell.dbc        cost floor lowered on 273 spells (talent-reduced costs cast at the real price)
  Item.dbc         286 classless item(s) registered (so their icons draw before the server is asked)
  CharStartOutfit.dbc  armored Hero look on 18 races +Blood Elf
  -> Data/patch-Z.MPQ
  GlueStrings.lua  76 class strings rewritten
  CharacterCreate.lua  class selector hidden
  Hero class icon      emblem on the Hero cell, other class icons kept
  -> Data/enUS/patch-enUS-Z.MPQ  (DBCs here outrank the client's own locale patches)
  Wow.exe          patched 6 site(s) to accept custom interface files
  addon            12 files -> Interface/AddOns/ClasslessWildcard
  cache            cleared (the client rebuilds it on next login)

Done. Start the game and every class will read Hero.
```

Then just start the game.

---

## Uninstall

```bash
python3 install.py --uninstall "C:\Games\World of Warcraft"
```

Windows users can run `install.bat --uninstall` instead.

This removes the patch archives, removes the addon, clears the cache, and, if an
older version had patched `Wow.exe`, restores it from the backup. Your client is
back to stock.

---

## Options

The full Hero client installs by default. These turn pieces off.

| Option                | Effect                                                                |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--dry-run`           | Print the plan and write nothing                                      |
| `--uninstall`         | Undo everything the installer did                                     |
| `--yes` / `-y`        | Skip the confirmation prompt                                          |
| `--name Champion`     | Call the class something other than `Hero`                            |
| `--no-creation-text`  | Skip the Hero text + armored outfit (and the `Wow.exe` patch they need) |
| `--no-hero-icon`      | Keep the stock class icon instead of the Hero emblem                  |
| `--no-exe`            | Install the text but not the `Wow.exe` patch (only for clients that already accept custom UI) |
| `--no-addon`          | Do not install the addon                                              |
| `--locale enUS`       | Patch one locale only, on a multi-language client                     |

The `Wow.exe` patch is the well-known "allow custom interface" patch (the same one the
Project Reforged patcher uses), confirmed working on a stock 3.3.5a build 12340 client.
It is backed up to `Wow.exe.classless-bak` and restored by `--uninstall`.

## Troubleshooting

**"Python 3 is required and was not found."**
Install Python and make sure you ticked *Add python.exe to PATH*. Restart the
command prompt afterwards.

**"That is not a World of Warcraft folder."**
Give it the folder that directly contains `Wow.exe` and `Data`, not a parent
folder and not the `Data` folder itself.

**"Your login interface files are corrupt" at the login screen.**
The `Wow.exe` patch that `--creation-text` applies did not take. Most often that is because
the game was open when you ran the installer, so the exe could not be written (the
output would have said *"close the game and re-run"*). Close World of Warcraft
completely and run `--creation-text` again. If it still happens after a clean patch,
your client is one the known patch does not fit. Run `--uninstall`; the Hero name and
single-class list work without it.

**Permission denied writing Wow.exe.**
Close the game. On Windows, run the command prompt as Administrator if your WoW
folder lives under `C:\Program Files`.

**Classes still show their old names**, or an item shows a question mark, or a
bow says "Out of range".
Delete the `Cache` folder in your WoW directory and start the game again -- see
[Close the game first, and let the cache go](#close-the-game-first-and-let-the-cache-go).
The installer does this for you, but a client left running can write it back.

**Class icons show as a green box.**
That means a `--hero-icon` install wrote a texture the client could not read.
Current versions match the client's own texture format, so update and re-run; if
it persists, reinstall with `--no-hero-icon` to keep the stock icon; everything else
is unaffected.

**The creation screen still shows the old class descriptions.**
The `Wow.exe` patch that lets the client load the custom text did not take, usually
because the game was open during install (it locks `Wow.exe`). Close the game fully and
run the installer again, or check with `--dry-run` whether it reports the exe as patched.

## A note on what gets shipped

This folder contains no Blizzard data. The installer reads the DBC and interface
files out of **your own client**, edits them on your machine, and writes the result
into a new patch archive next to the originals. Your original files are never
modified. Patch archives sit on top of them, and deleting them reverts everything.

`Wow.exe` is **never** modified by a default install, only new patch archives (which
sit on top of your originals) and the addon folder are written, so nothing you already
had is changed and deleting them reverts everything. The optional `--creation-text`
adds the rewritten `GlueStrings.lua` and applies the "allow custom interface" patch to
`Wow.exe` so the client accepts it; the exe is backed up to `Wow.exe.classless-bak`
first and `--uninstall` restores it. The patch only ever writes when its exact byte
sites are found in your exe, so a client it does not fit is left untouched rather than
corrupted.

Server admins and anyone curious about how the patch is built: see
[`MAINTAINERS.md`](MAINTAINERS.md).
