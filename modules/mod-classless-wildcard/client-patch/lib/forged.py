"""Client side of the forged spells: the Hero tab and the spells under it.

What this appends to the player's own tables:

  SkillLine.dbc         one row, the Hero line itself. Without it the tab has
                        no name and no icon.
  Spell.dbc             one row per forged spell and per hidden companion
  SpellVisual.dbc       one row per recombined look: a donor's row with some of
                        its kit slots pointed elsewhere. Each kit carries its
                        own sound, so this is where a new spell gets a look and
                        a sound that no stock spell has, without new art.
  SkillLineAbility.dbc  one row per visible spell, which is what files it under
                        the Hero tab. Hidden companions deliberately get none.

Nothing of Blizzard's lives in the repository: the manifest holds ids and the
columns each row changes, and every row is built by copying the player's own
donor row and applying that diff. A community patch's edits to columns this
does not touch survive.

The row appenders for Spell.dbc and SkillLineAbility.dbc are elemental.py's,
unchanged: the manifest is written in the shape they already read, so there is
one implementation of each rather than two that can drift.
